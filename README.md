Open [http://localhost:5173/betterIDE/](http://localhost:5173/betterIDE/) as simple as that!

#### Protocol land on localnet

Protocol Land has been implemented only through the local net by using `npx arlocal` and deploying the contract code and initial state from [sonar](https://sonar.warp.cc/#/app/contract/w5ZU15Y2cLzZlu3jewauIlnzbKw-OAxbN9G5TbuuiDQ?network=mainnet#code) and deployed it to npx arlocal through the same IDE.

**NOTE:** To use protocol land on your local dev machine, be sure to deploy it and copy the contract id and replace the `plandAddress` const in the `src/pages/PersonalProjects.tsx` and `src/pages/Browse.tsx` files, or cloud storage and protocol land wont work.

The source code used for this project is available in `proto-land-test.js` file.

We are working on a production ready version of protocol land integration, so stay tuned!
